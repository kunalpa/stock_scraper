# Python Scraper:
This program is designed to pull data from the internet, analyze them, and give recommendations on good potential investments.

## Instructions:
To use this program, simply edit the main function for the correct file you want to pull info from (It will either be S&P500.csv, medium.csv, or small.csv).
You can add other csv files, but it needs to fit the same format as the other files.
After doing that, just run the program, and everything should make sense.

## Summary of my process writing this program:
This side project was developed to further explore the knowledge acquired in my data structures class.
In my sort function, I timed different sorting algorithms to see which was the fastest based on stocks' volume, PE, EPS, beta, and market cap values. I found that even though my data structures professor mentioned that BST sort and merge sort were both O(NlogN), merge sort was the clear winner since the BST also required insertion. This simple task alone made the whole process 2x as long.
I saw a lot of potential in this program, so I decided to also use these values to give recommendations based on the user input on potentially good/better stocks to invest in.
This project was a lot of fun to build because it combined computer science with my interest in trading, and it helped me learn more in both.
